### *Vehicle Segmentation*
## Overview
This project focuses on segmenting vehicles into groups based on their features using unsupervised learning techniques. As part of an automotive company, the goal is to gain insights into vehicle characteristics and segment them into meaningful clusters based on attributes such as weight, engine size, and horsepower.

## Project Scenario
You are a member of an automotive company tasked with analyzing vehicle data to identify patterns and similarities among different models. By segmenting vehicles into groups with similar features, the company aims to better understand customer preferences, optimize inventory management, and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## Dataset
The dataset used for segmentation contains information about various vehicle features, including:

* Weight
* Engine size
* Horsepower
* Fuel efficiency
* Dimensions
* Transmission type
* Number of cylinders
* Wheelbase
* Price
* Methodology
  
The project follows these steps:

* Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and scale the features if necessary.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the distribution of vehicle features, identify correlations, and visualize data patterns.
* Feature Selection: Select relevant features for segmentation or perform dimensionality reduction techniques if dealing with high-dimensional data.
* Clustering Algorithm Selection: Experiment with various clustering algorithms such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN to identify the optimal number of clusters and their characteristics.
* Cluster Visualization: Visualize the clusters in feature space to interpret the results and understand the distinguishing features of each cluster.
* Cluster Evaluation: Evaluate the quality of the segmentation results using internal metrics such as silhouette score or external validation methods if ground truth labels are available.
* Interpretation and Insights: Interpret the segmentation results to extract meaningful insights about vehicle characteristics and group similarities.

## Usage
To run the project and perform vehicle segmentation:

* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
* Run the Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, segmentation, and visualization.
* Explore the segmented groups and analyze the characteristics of each segment.
